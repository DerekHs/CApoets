This project will extend functionality for an existing website that is in the
process of launching (CaliforniaPoets.org). The customer wishes to have a 
publishing platform that allows administrators to regulate and filter submitted
content. Accepted content (poems, photos, current events, past events, news)
will be added to the website.
