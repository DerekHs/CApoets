This project will extend functionality for an existing website (CaliforniaPoets.org). 
The customer wishes to have a submission form that is intuitive for users not that tech saavy to use.

The customer would also like a dashboard where the administrators can filter through
submitted literary content. Accepted content (poems, photos, current events, past events, news)
will be published immediately to CaliforniaPoets.org.
